Welcome to Tie Fighter oreientation. I had to upload my slides to a site used to share slides. It is owned by that one place that also posts hot jobs in your area. it is external to the empires websites but I think it should be safe.

Hint:
Check out some place where you might "share slides" on the internet or as master yoda would say slideshare you must  

Solution:
1. Go to slide share and searcxh for either "So You Want To Be A Tie Fighter" or "SiliCon5" or "Tiefightersupreme" 

Once there the flag was listed in the slides  

Flag:
Silicon{EmpireTieFighter123!!}
