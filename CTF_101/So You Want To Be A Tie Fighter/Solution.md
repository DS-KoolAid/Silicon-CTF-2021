Welcome to Tie Fighter oreientation. I had to upload my slides to a site used to share slides. It is owned by that one place that also posts hot jobs in your area. it is external to the empires websites but I think it should be safe.

Solution:
1. Go to slide share and search for either "So You Want To Be A Tie Fighter" or "SiliCon5" or "Tiefightersupreme" 
2. Go through slides and find flag on slide #5
