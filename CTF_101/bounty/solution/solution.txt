# This challenge's inspiration came from BSidesSF CTF 2021

# This Bind server has port 53 listening on UDP as well as TCP
# which is what's used for zone transfers. 

netstat -an

# TCP really shouldn't be listening to the public, so if you 
# see it open then it can be possible to pull all records at once.

# The other part of the challenge that requires a bit of exploration is
# knowing which domain to query against. With some trial and error,
# if we throw the silicon-ctf.party domain at it, which is the domain of our CTF,
# the DNS server will respond with results.

# Dig is a popular DNS query tool, so if we use that along with the
# zone transfer argument (AXFR), we can pull all records with one command.

dig silicon-ctf.party AXFR @localhost
