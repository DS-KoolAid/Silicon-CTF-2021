Clicking the link takes us to a website. We can go through the different links on the home page, but none of the pages contain anything interesting.

But if we pay attention to each pages URL, we will notice a URL parameter ID being set:
* Death Star Map - https://challenges.silicon-ctf.party/ctf101/guess/index.html?id=1
* Storm Trooper Armour Specifications - https://challenges.silicon-ctf.party/ctf101/guess/index.html?id=2
* Employee of the Month - https://challenges.silicon-ctf.party/ctf101/guess/index.html?id=4
* Blaster Specifications - https://challenges.silicon-ctf.party/ctf101/guess/index.html?id=5

What happened to id 3? Well, if we go to https://challenges.silicon-ctf.party/ctf101/guess/index.html?id=3, we find a hidden page with an image showing the flag!
