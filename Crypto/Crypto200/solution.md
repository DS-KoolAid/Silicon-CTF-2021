# Crypto 200 - Secret Note

## Challenge Text:

One of our spies passed us this note about the Death Star. However, it seems they are using an older code... it still checks out.. but we are not able to decrypt it. Can you give it a try? 

We know the first few words are:
`The Death Star has one critical flaw.`

## How to Solve: 

This challenge is a substitution cipher. Since we have the first few words of the message and the substitution cipher seems to have a 1:1 mapping, we can start to build out a dictionary. 

Eventually, we end up with this: 

`The Death Star has one critical flaw. There is an exhaust port that is no larger than a womp rat. If we can shoot into this whole, the whole Death Start will implode. silicon{Substitution_ciphers_dont_like_known_plaintext}`
