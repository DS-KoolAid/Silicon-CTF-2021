        The time has arrived to launch our cyber assault on the Empire in order to save the galaxy!
        <br><br>
        To begin our mission, we first must find the plans for their new battlestation. One of our spies discovered their employee portal and our intel suggests this is where the plans are being held. However, the plans seem to be behind a login page, we'll have to find a way in.
