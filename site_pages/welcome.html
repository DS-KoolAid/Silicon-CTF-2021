          It has been many years but the empire is back and, yet again, building the death star (for like the 20th time). Each iteration of the death star has gotten more advanced and dangerous, but all seem to have one fatal flaw: that womp-rat sized tube that leads directly to the death star’s fuel source.
   <br><br>
  However, this time something is different. All of the Xwing scouts have not been able to spot the vulnerability in the death star. Has the empire finally made an impenetrable death star?
   <br><br>
  …Not likely… (they can’t make storm troopers that shoot straight, there’s no way)
   <br><br>
  You and your team are on a special team of elite hackers within the rebel army. Your task is to penetrate the empire’s cyber defenses and obtain the necessary knowledge to locate the fatal flaw in the death star.
