        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How will the Splunk portion work?</p>
        <p>A: <b>The Splunk BOTs portion will only be running from June 2nd to June 4th</b>. Your team will be given a separate login for the Splunk instance beforehand. You will have one login per team. You will be submitting your answers to the Splunk challenges on their scoring server. If you join the CTF once it has started, please contact a CTF Admin to get you your Splunk login.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Q: How does the Splunk scoring work?</p>
        <p>A: The Splunk questions give fewer points the later you answer them. There are also penalties for submitting incorrect answers and hints cost points. Also, any points  you earn on the Splunk side won’t automatically reflect on the https://silicon-ctf.party website. We will be updating that as the CTF goes on so don’t worry, they will be counted. There will also be a Splunk challenge added to the CTF site to indicate to folks that this challenge is live.</p>
        <p>Here's how Splunk points will transfer over to the CTF points. It will be done at a ratio of 20 Splunk points to 1 CTF point. So for each Splunk point option that would be:</p>
        <ul>
              <li>50 Splunk points: 2.5 CTF points</li>
              <li>100 Splunk points: 5 CTF points</li>
            <li>250 Splunk points: 12.5 CTF points</li>
            <li>500 Splunk points: 25 CTF points</li>
            <li>1000 Splunk points: 50 CTF points</li>
            <li>1500 Splunk points: 75 CTF points</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So with this in mind, if you answer every question correctly (ignoring bonuses/penalties), you can get a total of 1500 points from the Splunk questions. If you end up with a decimal in your score, we will round up!</p>
